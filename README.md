## Project Overview

ESSCO Project Tracker is designed to help project managers, engineers, and teams:

- Track multiple projects, each with its own job number, client, PM, and status (active, hold, archived)
- Log and review meeting notes, decisions, and next steps for each project
- Manage tasks in Kanban or table view, with priorities, due dates, assignees, and links to meeting notes
- Visualize project health and workload with an insights dashboard
- Operate fully offline, with all data stored in the browser (no cloud, no login)
- Export/import data for backup or transfer

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bpopineau/essco-tracker.git
cd SinglePageWebApp
```

Or simply download and unzip the folder.

### 2. Open in Browser

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build or server required.

### 3. (Optional) Install as App

- In Chrome/Edge: Click the install icon in the address bar to add to your desktop.

---

## Usage


## Usage Guide

### Sidebar
- Search and filter projects by name, client, PM, or job number
- Add new projects with the "+ Project" button
- Select a project to view its details, notes, tasks, and insights

### Header
- Displays selected project info (job number, name, client, PM, status)
- Export all data as JSON (for backup or transfer)
- Import data from a JSON file (merges with current data)
- Quick actions: add meeting note, add task, delete/archive project

### Tabs
- **Notes**: Add, edit, and review meeting notes for the selected project. Each note can be linked to tasks.
- **Tasks**: Add, edit, and move tasks between statuses (Kanban or Table view). Tasks can be linked to meeting notes, assigned to users, prioritized, and given due dates.
- **Insights**: Visualize open/overdue tasks, workload by assignee, and meeting coverage (how many notes have linked tasks).

### Quick Add & Linking
- Use "Quick Add Task" for fast entry of new tasks
- Link tasks to meeting notes for traceability
- Attach files to tasks (browser support required)

### Import/Export
- Export your entire database as a JSON file for backup or migration
- Import a JSON file to restore or merge data

---

## Data Model

- **Users**: Project managers and assignees.
- **Projects**: Each with job number, name, client, PM, status, and start date.
- **Notes**: Meeting notes per project, with date and body.
- **Tasks**: Linked to projects (and optionally notes), with assignee, status, priority, due date, and attachments.

### Example Data Structure

```js
{
  users: [ { id, name, email } ],
  projects: [ { id, job_number, name, client, status, pm_user_id, start_date } ],
  notes: [ { id, project_id, meeting_date, body } ],
  tasks: [ { id, project_id, note_id, title, assignee_user_id, status, priority, due_date, attachments } ],
  ui: { selectedProjectId, activeTab, viewMode, ... }
}
```

---

## Architecture

- **Frontend Only**: 100% client-side, no backend or server required
- **State Management**: Simple observable store pattern (`src/store.js`)
- **Persistence**: Uses browser `localStorage` for main data, and IndexedDB for file attachments
- **Modular UI**: All UI logic is in `src/views/` (header, sidebar, notes, tasks, insights)
- **Utilities**: Date formatting, ID generation, and DOM helpers in `src/utils/` and `src/ui/`
- **PWA**: Service worker (`sw.js`) and manifest for installability and offline support

---

## UI Walkthrough

### Main Layout
- **Sidebar**: Project list, search/filter, and "+ Project" button
- **Header**: Project details, status, and quick actions (export, import, add note/task, delete/archive)
- **Tabs**: Switch between Notes, Tasks, and Insights
- **Content Area**: Displays notes, tasks, or insights for the selected project

### Notes
- Add new meeting notes with date and body
- Link tasks to notes for traceability
- See how many tasks are linked to each note

### Tasks
- Kanban view: Drag-and-drop tasks between statuses (Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
- Table view: See all tasks in a sortable table
- Quick add: Enter title, assignee, priority, due date, and note link in one row
- Attach files to tasks (if browser supports File System Access API)

### Insights
- Workload chart: Visualizes open tasks by assignee (color-coded for overdue, due soon, OK)
- Meeting coverage: Shows what % of meeting notes have at least one linked task
- Overdue and due-soon task counts

## Offline & PWA Details

- **Offline-First**: All data is stored in your browser; works with no internet connection
- **PWA**: Installable on desktop (and some mobile browsers) for an app-like experience
- **Service Worker**: Caches core files for offline use; updates automatically when new files are available
- **Data Storage**: Uses `localStorage` for main data, IndexedDB for file attachments (see `src/storage/`)

---

## Extending & Customizing

- **Add More Fields**: Extend the schema in `src/schema.js` and update UI in `src/views/`
- **Custom Branding**: Edit `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `icon.svg`
- **Add More Views**: Create new modules in `src/views/` and add to the main UI
- **Integrate with Backend**: (Advanced) Replace or supplement `storage.js` with API calls

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Data not saving?** Ensure your browser allows localStorage and IndexedDB
- **File attachments not working?** Use Chrome or Edge on desktop for File System Access API support
- **App not updating?** Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear browser cache
- **Import/Export issues?** Only import files exported from this app; merging is shallow (overwrites by key)

---

## FAQ

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes. All data stays in your browser/device. No cloud, no tracking, no login.

**Q: Can I use this with a team?**
A: This app is designed for single-user or small-team use on a shared device. For multi-user sync, a backend would be needed.

**Q: How do I back up my data?**
A: Use the Export button in the header to download a JSON backup. Import restores or merges data.

**Q: Can I add more fields or change the workflow?**
A: Yes! The code is modular and easy to extend. See the Extending section above.

**Q: What browsers are supported?**
A: Chrome and Edge (desktop) are fully supported. Firefox and Safari work, but file attachments may be limited.

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation is supported throughout the app (tab, enter, escape, etc.)
- High-contrast color scheme for readability
- All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and have visible focus
- ARIA roles and labels are used where appropriate

---

## Security & Privacy

- All data is stored locally in your browser; nothing is sent to any server
- No analytics, tracking, or third-party scripts
- File attachments are stored using browser APIs and never leave your device
- To clear all data, use your browser's storage/cookie settings or the "Reset Seed" button (in DEV mode)

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch
2. Make your changes with clear commit messages
3. Test thoroughly in Chrome/Edge (and optionally Firefox/Safari)
4. Open a pull request with a description of your changes

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss your ideas.

## Release & Versioning

- The app version is tracked in `src/version.js` and displayed in the UI
- Releases are tagged in git and described in the changelog (if present)
- Semantic versioning is followed: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

---

## Best Practices & Recommendations

- Use Chrome or Edge for the best experience and full feature support
- Regularly export your data as a backup
- For team use, consider a shared device or export/import workflow
- To reset to the default seed, use the DEV "Reset Seed" button (if enabled)
